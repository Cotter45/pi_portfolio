  "one": "My name is Sean, I'm a 33-year-old software engineer currently working at Nestle Nespresso. Before I became a programmer, I worked in construction for almost a decade. However, when my son was born, I realized I wanted a career that would allow me to spend more time with my family. So, after a few years of casually programming on the side, I attended App Academy's full stack Javascript & Python bootcamp to learn programming fundamentals and develop my skills.",
  "two": "Thanks to my hard work and dedication, I was able to make the transition into a career in tech. My background in construction has taught me the importance of attention to detail and efficiency, skills which have served me well in my current role as a software engineer as well as in every day life, especially parenthood!",
  "three": "When I'm not coding, I enjoy spending time with my family, hiking, playing video games, making music and searching for treasure at any / every location with my son. I'm a passionate person who strives to remain consistent in the use of my problem-solving skills to create innovative solutions and make a positive impact on the world."
